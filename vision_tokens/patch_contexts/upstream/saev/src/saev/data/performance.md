# Performance
SAEs are mostly disk-bound.
Gemma Scope (Google SAE paper) aimed for 1 GB/s to keep their GPUS brrr'ing.
This is pretty hard even with sequential reads, much less random access.

I run all my experiments on [OSC](https://www.osc.edu/) and their scratch filesystem `/fs/scratch` has sequential read speeds of around 800 MB/s and random access speeds around 22 MB/s.

I got these numbers with:

```sh
fio --name=net --filename=/fs/scratch/PAS2136/samuelstevens/cache/saev/366017a10220b85014ae0a594276b25f6ea3d756b74d1d3218da1e34ffcf32e9/acts000000.bin --rw=read --bs=1M --direct=1 --iodepth=16 --runtime=30 --time_based
```

and

```sh
fio --name=net --filename=/fs/scratch/PAS2136/samuelstevens/cache/saev/366017a10220b85014ae0a594276b25f6ea3d756b74d1d3218da1e34ffcf32e9/acts000000.bin --rw=randread --bs=4K --direct=1 --iodepth=16 --runtime=30 --time_based
```

These two commands reported, respectively:

```
READ: bw=796MiB/s (835MB/s), 796MiB/s-796MiB/s (835MB/s-835MB/s), io=23.3GiB (25.0GB), run=30001-30001msec
```

and

```
READ: bw=22.9MiB/s (24.0MB/s), 22.9MiB/s-22.9MiB/s (24.0MB/s-24.0MB/s), io=687MiB (721MB), run=30001-30001msec
```

My naive pytorch-style dataset that uses multiple processes to feed a dataloader did purely random reads and was too slow.
It reports around 500 examples/s:

![Performance plot showing that naive random access dataloading maxes out around 500 examples/s.](assets/benchmarking/ee86c12134a89ea819b129bcce0d1abbda5143c4/plot.png)

I've implemented a dataloader that tries to do sequential reads rather than random reads in `saev/data/iterable.py`.
It's much faster (around 4.5K examples/s) on OSC.

![Performance plot showing that my first attempt at a sequential dataloader maxes out around 4500 examples/s.](assets/benchmarking/4e9b2faf065ffb21e635633a2ee485bd699b0941/plot.png)

I know that it should be even faster; the dataset of 128M examples is 2.9TB, my sequential disk read speed is 800 MB/s, so it should take ~1 hr.
For 128M examples at 4.5K examples/s, it should take 7.9 hours.
You can see this on a [wandb run here](https://wandb.ai/samuelstevens/saev/runs/okm4fv8j?nw=nwusersamuelstevens&panelDisplayName=Disk+Utilization+%28%25%29&panelSectionName=System) which reports 14.6% disk utilization.
Certainly that can be higher.

> *Not sure if this is the correct way to think about it, but: 100 / 14.6 = 6.8, close to 7.9 hours.*

## Ordered Dataloader Design

The `saev/data/ordered.py` module implements a high-throughput ordered dataloader that guarantees sequential data delivery.
This is useful for iterating through all patches in an image at once.

### Key Design Decisions

1. Single-threaded I/O in Manager Process
   
   Initially, the dataloader used multiple worker threads for parallel I/O, similar to PyTorch's DataLoader. However, this created a fundamental ordering problem: when multiple workers read batches in parallel, they complete at different times and deliver batches out of order.
   
   We switched to single-threaded I/O because:
   - Sequential reads from memory-mapped files are already highly optimized by the OS
   - The OS page cache provides excellent performance for sequential access patterns
   - Eliminating multi-threading removes all batch reordering complexity
   - The simpler design is more maintainable and debuggable

2. Process Separation with Ring Buffer
   
   The dataloader still uses a separate manager process connected via a multiprocessing Queue (acting as a ring buffer). This provides:
   - Overlap between I/O and computation
   - Configurable read-ahead via `buffer_size` parameter
   - Natural backpressure when computation is slower than I/O
   - Process isolation for better resource management

3. Shard-Aware Sequential Reading
   
   The dataloader correctly handles the actual distribution of data across shards by:
   - Reading `shards.json` to get the exact number of images per shard
   - Maintaining cumulative offsets for efficient index-to-shard mapping
   - Handling batches that span multiple shards without gaps or duplicates

### Performance Considerations

- Memory-mapped files: Using `np.memmap` allows efficient access to large files without loading them entirely into memory
- Sequential access pattern: The dataloader reads data in the exact order it's stored on disk, maximizing OS cache effectiveness
- Minimal data copying: Activations are copied only once from the memory-mapped file to PyTorch tensors
- Read-ahead buffering: The configurable buffer size allows tuning the trade-off between memory usage and I/O overlap

### Trade-offs

The single-threaded design trades potential parallel I/O throughput for:
- Guaranteed ordering
- Simplicity and maintainability  
- Elimination of synchronization overhead
- Predictable performance characteristics

In practice, the sequential read performance is sufficient for most use cases, especially when the computation (e.g., SAE forward pass) is the bottleneck rather than I/O.
